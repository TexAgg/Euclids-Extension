# GCD-Extenstion
Google Chrome extension for the implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm as presented in "Algorithmic Number Theory" by Bach and Shallit.
Calculates gcd(u,v)=d and a,b that satisfy au+bv=d.

Due to the initial cost of $5 for putting a Chrome Extension on the extension store, this has not yet been released.
